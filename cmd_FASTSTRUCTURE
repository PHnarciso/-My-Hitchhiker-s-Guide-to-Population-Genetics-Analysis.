===== FASTSTRUCTURE =====

FastStructure is an algorithm for inferring population structure from large SNP genotype data. It is based on a variational Bayesian framework for posterior inference and is written in Python2.

- PREPARATION OF INPUT
Use input from PCA <*_inputPCA.csv>
Open it in LibreOffice or similar
Delete everything that is not marker and sample metadata (code and name of the animals)
Save the file as *_FastStructure.csv
Open the file with ATOM(or similae) and check the delimiter, it should be a comma TO RUN

Access command line as an administrator:
--> su root

COMMAND (lizards are awesome pipeline):
--> laa all input.csv --maxk=n

COMMAND (logistic):

# K=4
--> python ./structure.py -K 4 --input="*_FastStructure" --output="path of output file" --tol=10e-8 --prior=logistic --full

COMMAND (logistic/nohup):
# K=3 and nohup
--> nohup python ./structure.py -K 3 --input="*_FastStructure" --output="path of output file" --tol=10e-8 --prior=logistic --full &

*input = *_FastStructure.csv
*I can use the PCA result as a guide to define the maximum k
*To run on the cluster, use sftp to upload the input, ssh (root) to execute the command
*Generated outputs can be used in CLUMPAK for visualization of population structure.
