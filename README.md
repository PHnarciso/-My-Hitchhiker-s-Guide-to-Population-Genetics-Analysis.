# -My-Hitchhiker-s-Guide-to-Population-Genetics-Analysis.
Compilation of "useful" scripts or step-by-step guides for file conversion, software execution and other tasks.

In this repository, I intend to gather everything I used (scripts, step-by-step guides, manuals, references) to carry out the projects I was able to participate in population genetics of Neotropical fish. The goal is to maintain a personal reference and maybe contribute to the work of others.
