Compilation of "useful" scripts or step-by-step guides for file conversion, software execution and other tasks.

In this repository, I aim to gather scripts, step-by-step guides, manuals, and related resources, while I try to learn a little about bioinformatics, populatio genetics, biotechnology, and related topics. The intention is to maintain a personal reference point and, hopefully, provide usefulness to others.
